1. State differences between Python 2 and Python 3 version.

i) Python 3 syntax is simple and easy to understand.
On the other hand, Python 2 syntax is complex and comparatively difficult to understand.

ii) In Python 2, print statement is used for displaying output.
Whereas in Python 3, the print statement has been replaced with a print() function
Ex: For displaying output,
In Python 2 print “Python ICP1” is used but in Python 3 it is print (“Python ICP1”)

iii) In Python 3, variables value does not change.
Whereas in Python 2, global variables value will be changed while using it inside for-loop.

iv) Integer division returns float values in python 3.x and integer values in 2.x
 Ex: Python 3.x
     print 9 / 4     Output: 2.25
     print -9 / 4    Output: -2.25

     Python 2.x
     print 9 / 4     Output: 2
     print -9 / 4    Output: -3

v) In Python 3, Range() function is used to perform iterations whereas in Python 2, the xrange() is used to perform iterations.

vi) In Python 3, default storing of strings is Unicode.
Whereas in Python 2 to store Unicode string value, we have to define them with "u".
